| Monero                               | Esperanto | Monero/门罗币/门罗        | It's prefered to use the original term "Monero". If it has to be tranlslated, "门罗币" is better than "门罗",  two are indifferent in most of context, but given suggestion from json@one, “门罗币" is a more written expression and "门罗" is a more colloquial expression. |
| XMR                                  | English   | XMR/门罗币                | When people use "XMR" to specify Monero COINS, "门罗币" is significantly better than "门罗", since "币" means COINS in Chinese.                                                                                                                                              |
| Moneroj                              | Esperanto | XMR/门罗币                | "Moneroj" is the plural form of "Monero" (as COINS) in Esperanto, and since there is no conceptual category of singular/plural form in Chinese, the translation should be the same as that of "XMR".                                                                         |
| Monerujo                             | Esperanto | Monerujo                  | "Monerujo" means Monero wallet in Esperanto, and there is an Anroid Mobile Wallet named "Monerujo". For the latter, there is no official Chinese name of it, so I suggest we use the original "Monerujo".                                                                    |
